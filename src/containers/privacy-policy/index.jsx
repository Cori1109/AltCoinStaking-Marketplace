                                Where Bitcoin was hailed as the digital answer
                                to currency, NFTs are now being touted as the
                                digital answer to collectables, but plenty of
                                sceptics fear they&apos;re a bubble waiting to
                                burst.

                                It could be a house, or a painting such as the
                                Mona Lisa, which is one of a kind. You can take
                                a photo of the painting or buy a print but there
                                will only ever be one original painting.

                                Allsopp said the concept of buying NFTs made
                                &quot;no sense&quot;. &quot;The idea of buying
                                something which isn&apos;t there is just
                                strange,&quot; he told the BBC.

                                It might sound ridiculous but the explosive
                                market of crypto-collectibles and crypto-art is
                                no joke. I investigate cryptocurrencies and have
                                academic publications on Bitcoin markets. To
                                help you understand what an NFT is and why
                                they’re becoming so popular, here’s an explainer
                                to make sense of it all.

                                The bidding on Musk’s tweet has already topped
                                $1 million and millions more are pouring into
                                the market — he has since tweeted, “Actually,
                                doesn’t feel quite right selling this. Will
                                pass.” And sites like NBA Top Shot (where you
                                can buy, sell and trade digital NBA cards) have
                                individual cards selling for over US$200,000.

                                A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file
                                with verified identity and ownership. This
                                verification is done using blockchain
                                technology. Blockchain technology, simply put,
                                is an un-hackable system based on the
                                mathematics of cryptography. So, that’s why you
                                hear a lot of “crypto” when referring to NFTs —
                                crypto-art, crypto-collectibles, etc.

                                revolutionizing our conception of money and
                                value, creating not just entirely new markets
                                but even new economies that are able to scale
                                globally and to discover value in undreamt
                                places, relegating to oblivion fiat currencies
                                and old ways of doing business.

                                Just kidding. The previous paragraph is a parody
                                (if such is possible) of the hype that in the
                                first half of 2021 has come to surround
                                non-fungible tokens. Indeed, the hype has become
                                so overpowering that it may even defy parody.
                                Non-fungible tokens can have legitimacy, and
                                I’ll discuss how that can be at the end of this
                                article. But for now the overwhelming majority
                                of what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled by
                                the hope of a quick return and the belief that
                                something can be gotten for nothing (or
                                virtually nothing).

                                be, are—without exception or remainder—digital
                                files. In other words, they’re just strings of
                                bits. As a string of bits, a digital file has a
                                fixed number of bits, with the bit at any
                                location in the string having a definite value
                                of either zero or one.{" "}

                                Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be
                                interchanged with other individual assets of the
                                same kind; it implies equal value between the
                                assets. If you own a fungible asset you can
                                readily interchange it for another of a similar
                                kind. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and
                                trade processes, and the best example would be
                                (you guessed it) money.

                                This is where I can explain and emphasize the
                                “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main
                                difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact
                                that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible (you can
                                trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the
                                same value and price). NFTs are unique but
                                unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are
                                the same). While NFTs can appreciate in value
                                (just like real estate), they cannot be
                                interchanged for another NFT.
