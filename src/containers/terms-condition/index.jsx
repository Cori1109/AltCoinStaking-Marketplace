                            Just kidding. The previous paragraph is a parody (if
                            such is possible) of the hype that in the first half
                            of 2021 has come to surround non-fungible tokens.
                            Indeed, the hype has become so overpowering that it
                            may even defy parody. Non-fungible tokens can have
                            legitimacy, and I’ll discuss how that can be at the
                            end of this article. But for now the overwhelming
                            majority of what passes for NFTs is delusion, fueled
                            by the hope of a quick return and the belief that
                            something can be gotten for nothing (or virtually
                            nothing).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is where I can explain and emphasize the
                            “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main
                            difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact
                            that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible (you can
                            trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the
                            same value and price). NFTs are unique but
                            unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are the
                            same). While NFTs can appreciate in value (just like
                            real estate), they cannot be interchanged for
                            another NFT.

                            Warren Buffett famously remarked in 2018 that
                            Bitcoin (and by implication all cryptocurrencies)
                            were “probably rat poison squared.” That seems
                            unduly pessimistic given that cryptocurrencies
                            provide a way of securely moving around things that
                            at least look like currency and that in some locales
                            are actually being used like currency. In Venezuela,
                            for instance, Bitcoin provides one way around the
                            country’s corrupt central bank and the
                            hyperinflation it has created. And in early June of
                            2021, the El Salvador government even approved
                            Bitcoin as legal tender.

                            While not directly related to NFTs, it’s important
                            to mention some properties of money. Among many
                            properties, money has to be fungible (one unit is
                            viewed as interchangeable as another), and divisible
                            (can be divided into smaller units of value). NFTs
                            are not fungible nor (easily) divisible. For
                            example, a single dollar is easily convertible into
                            four quarters or ten dimes, but currently you cannot
                            divide one NFT (although the blockchain technology
                            behind may allow it in future).{" "}

                            The importance of NFTs lies in providing the ability
                            to securely value, purchase and exchange digital art
                            using a digital ledger. NFTs started in online
                            gaming, later with Nike’s patenting of its
                            authenticity (CryptoKicks) and then by the famous
                            Christie’s auction embracing NFT valuation of a
                            digital art piece. NFTs are commonly created by
                            uploading files, such as digital artwork, to an
                            auction market. Just like any other form of art,
                            NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, making them
                            more like “collectible” items.
